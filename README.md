# prettier_d_slim

## Update -

This fork is to ensure that prettier_d_slim installs a "prettier_d" binary (for ALE compatibility) and uses the latest
version of "prettier" (v2.3.2 at the time).  (The authors last commit refers to pretty v1.19 which is very old and
typescript support is broken.)

Makes [prettier][] fast.

## "But prettier is pretty fast already, right?"

Yes, it's really fast. But the node.js startup time and loading all the
required modules slows down linting times for a single file to ~700
milliseconds. `prettier_d_slim` reduces this overhead by running a server in the
background. It brings the formatting time down to ~130 milliseconds. If you want
to format from within your editor whenever you save a file, `prettier_d_slim` is for
you.

## Install

This will install the `prettier_d_slim` command globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g prettier_d_slim
```

## Usage

To start the server and lint a file, just run:

```bash
# Prettier needs to know the file name to do its thing.
$ cat file.js | prettier_d_slim --stdin --stdin-filepath file.js
# Or if you already have the content of the file:
$ prettier_d_slim --stdin-filepath file.js --text 'const foo = {}'
```

On the initial call, the `prettier_d_slim` server is launched and then the given file
is formatted. Subsequent invocations are super fast.

## How does this work?

The first time you use `prettier_d_slim`, a little server is started in the background
and bound to a random port. The port number is stored along with [a
token][change401] in `~/.prettier_d_slim`. You can then run `prettier_d_slim` commands the
same way you would use `prettier` and it will delegate to the background server.
It will load a [separate instance][change220] of prettier for each working
directory to make sure settings are kept local. If prettier is found in the
current working directories `node_modules` folder, then this version of prettier
is going to be used. Otherwise, the version of prettier that ships with
`prettier_d_slim` is used as a fallback.

To keep the memory footprint low, `prettier_d_slim` keeps only the last 10 used
instances in the internal [nanolru][] cache.

## Which versions of prettier are supported?

As far as I'm aware, all of them.

## Commands

Control the server like this:

```bash
$ prettier_d_slim <command>
```

Available commands:

- `start`: start the server
- `stop`: stop the server
- `status`: print out whether the server is currently running
- `restart`: restart the server
- `[options] file.js [file.js] [dir]`: invoke `prettier` with the given options.
  The `prettier` engine will be created in the current directory. If the server
  is not yet running, it is started.

Type `prettier_d_slim --help` to see the supported `prettier` options.

`prettier_d_slim` will select a free port automatically and store the port number
along with an access token in `~/.prettier_d_slim`.

## Moar speed

If you're really into performance and want the lowest possible latency, talk to
the `prettier_d_slim` server with netcat. This will also eliminate the node.js startup
time.

```bash
$ PORT=`cat ~/.prettier_d_slim | cut -d" " -f1`
$ TOKEN=`cat ~/.prettier_d_slim | cut -d" " -f2`
$ echo "$TOKEN $PWD file.js" | nc localhost $PORT
```

Or if you want to work with stdin:

```bash
$ echo "$TOKEN $PWD --stdin" | cat - file.js | nc localhost $PORT
```

This runs `prettier` in under `50ms`!

If you're interested in building something similar to this: Most of the logic
was extracted to [core_d][], a library that manages the background server.
